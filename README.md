# Confusing-color-game
A cool game to have fun and learn some basics of GUI.
This game displays name of colors and the player has to enter the color in which the test is written and not the text itself.
The game starts with initially 30 seconds and as the player inputs the correct answer the timer is increased by 2 seconds.
Have fun experimenting with the GUI and the features of the game.
